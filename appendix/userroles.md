# User Roles

There are many views (aka panes) available through the Data Browser that provide access to a wealth of functionality. However, users can sometimes feel overwhelmed by the large number of available options when accessing resources within their Pod. 

To improve the Data Browser user experience, not to mention the onboarding process for new users, the views that are displayed for a particular resource are based on the user's selected role(s):
* Normal User. Can view all standard social views.
* Developer. In addition to Normal User, view Data, N3, and RDF views of the data.
* Power User. In addition to Normal User, view additional Data Browser views such as Note Pad and Meetings.

By default, you are not assigned to any extra roles (i.e., Normal User). You can update your assigned roles via the [Preferences](https://github.com/solid/userguide/README.md#Preferences) page in the Dashboard. The Data Browser will use the assigned roles to determine which views are applicable for you.

_Notes:_
* _An exception is made to the views displayed for a given resource, if it makes sharing resources easier._
* _Your selected role(s) are be stored in your settings which are private by default._

Below is a table that documents the existing Data Browser views and the user types that are associated with them.
